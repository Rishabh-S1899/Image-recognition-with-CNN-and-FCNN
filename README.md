We build a simple image classifier trained on cifar-3 dataset. Two approaches have been explored:
1.)Fully Connected Neural Network based classification (Multi Layer Perceptron)
2.)Combined Convolutional Neural Networks and feed forward neural networks

The CNN based network outperformed the MLP and achieved a better accuracy on the test set.
